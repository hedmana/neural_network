# Neural Network From Scratch
I read a book explaining the math behind a simple neural network and decided to put it to practice. This repo contains a neural network implemented from skratch using NumPy. It tackels the MNIST digit classifiaction problem, also known as the "Hello World" of neural networks. 

For this model I'm using is a preprocessed dataset found on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/data?select=test.csv.
