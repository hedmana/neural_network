# Neural Network From Scratch
I read a book explaining the math behind a simple neural network and decided to put it to practice. This repository contains a neural network (neural_network.ipynb) implemented from skratch using NumPy and math. The neural network is implemented to tackle the MNIST digit classification problem.
